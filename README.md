# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-Python
An attempt in a beginner's tic-tac-toe challenge, coded with python. 
This serves to track my progress as I code in my coding journey. 

This is currently attempt #2, which is close to completion but have few bugs still. 


Attempt #3 will be done next week or so, with different ways of writing it in python
